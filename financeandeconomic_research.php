            <h3 class="caas_heading">Finance and Economic Research</h3>


            <p>Economic consultants apply techniques of economic analysis to help businesses, regulators and policy makers evaluate and implement strategic decisions. </p>

            <p>We use microeconomic theory, econometrics, quantitative techniques and financial modelling in conjunction with sector expertise to formulate tailored advice to organizations.  Typical problems may include helping a company with a merger opportunity, advising a company on how to respond to new taxation regulation, or analysing drivers of demand for public services. </p>

            <p>Economic consultancies often specialise in certain sectors, such as financial services, telecommunications, or utilities. CAAS  also provide particular kinds of consultancy expertise, such as competition policy, regulation, or market analysis. </p>

            <h4>Market trends </h4>

            <p>Since economic consultancy focuses on factors that are often central to the state of the economy, and how those factors can be managed by businesses, work can be generated by the slowdown. </p>

            <p>The current view from one particular independent economic consultancy is that activity has held up fairly well during the recent recession. The drop in merger activity has hit anti-trust cases but regulation and litigation work has been stronger. There has also been a strong appetite for advice related to the increased amount of state aid available during the recent economic crisis. </p>

            <h4>CAAS Econometrics</h4>

                                <p>Restricted access to research findings and scientific discovery through subscription and pay-per-view journals will only impede communication through the scientific community. In addition, restricted access can also hamper the education and dissemination of scientific knowledge to the aspiring younger generations who are keen to pursue a career in science. Increased productivity and development of science can only be achieved by diffusing knowledge and providing the facilities for creating permanent repositories such as Open Access.
                                    Through Open Access publications, scientists can avoid subscription fees and copyright and licensing restrictions to access free scholarly literature. Since Open Access publishing allows the permanent restoration of scientific data through digital copies, other than the constraint of Internet access, scientists around the world can freely share information and collaborate to enhance the progress of science.Open Access journals not only give royalty to free literature, but also reduce costs for paper-copy production, physical storage, and distribution through digitalized copies.</p>
                                <p>The benefits of implementing Open Access are reaped by many end users, such as, students, researchers, clinicians, patients, policy makers, and journalists. As long as there is Internet access, people from all over the world, be it an underdeveloped country in Africa, a developing country like India or developed countries such as USA or UK, will have immediate access to latest research findings. Thus, Open Access initiative helps in unlocking the traditional methods of subscription articles and releasing information to tertiary level readers, who normally would not have access to first hand research studies.</p>
                                <p>Realizing the potential of Open Access in terms of greater visibility within and beyond the scientific community, in recent years, there has been a tremendous boost to Open Access movement through various Open Access publishers. CAAS is one such publishing group that believes in this movement and is most ardently working towards the welfare and progress of scientific community. CAAS Group is built upon the principles of Open Access and is determined to provide free and unrestricted access of research articles to scientists around the world for the advancement of science and technology.</p>
